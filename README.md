####1. Change directory

Make sure you are in `pwnedapp/pwnedapp`

####2. Initialize

1. Run `bower install`. **You only need to do this once to install packages.**

2. Run `npm install`. **You only need to do this once to install dependencies.**

3. Run `npm install -g grunt-cli`. **You only need to do this once to install grunt globally.**

4. Run `grunt default` to concatenate and minify the Angular code and packages. You only have to do this once **unless** you are working on client-side (AngularJS) code.

In your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

Structure:
-------------

**/models** is where DB schemas are stored

**/common** is where I put common functionality I need across multiple files that I
haven't 'modulized' yet.

**/public** is a 'webroot' for serving static files (images/stylesheets/etc)

**/routes** contains routing functions (ex '/' is the root).

**/views** contains partials

**/components** contains components for the client-side
